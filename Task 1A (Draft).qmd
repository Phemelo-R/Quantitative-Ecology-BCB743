## Introduction and Open Science Context

Ecological research today relies on **open data repositories** and **field campaign platforms** that provide wide access to diverse environmental datasets. In line with *open science* principles, these systems make biodiversity, climate, and ecosystem data freely available for reuse, enabling transparency, reproducibility, and collaborative discovery. Many are funded as national or international research infrastructures and require robust data management, standardized metadata, and clear licensing to facilitate data sharing. The **FAIR data principles** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) are widely embraced, ensuring that data and metadata can be discovered and integrated across platforms [@DataONE2025]. For example, the South African Environmental Observation Network’s Open Data Platform explicitly aims to *“promote open science and satisfy funder requirements through the publication of data and scientific evidence”* [@SAEON2024] . Likewise, global networks like **GBIF** (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) stress the *“importance and value of open biodiversity data”* as evidenced by thousands of studies built on shared data [@GBIF2024a]. This lecture provides a critical overview of major open ecological data repositories and field campaign platforms – spanning global initiatives and South African examples – and examines their scope, features, strengths, limitations, and usage in research. We will also discuss how these platforms embody open science ideals and have enabled concrete ecological research projects.

## Major Open Ecological Data Repositories and Platforms

Open ecological data platforms come in several forms. **Global-scale repositories** aggregate data from many providers and regions (e.g. GBIF, PANGAEA, DataONE), while **observatory networks** and **field campaign portals** collect data from specific sites or projects (e.g. LTER sites, NEON in the USA, TERN in Australia, SAEON in South Africa). Some focus on particular data domains (biodiversity records, climate measurements, etc.), whereas others offer broad multidisciplinary environmental data. Below, we review several leading examples – **GBIF**, **NEON**, **PANGAEA**, **LTER**, **SAEON**, **DataONE**, and the **Atlas of Living Australia** – describing their data scope, key features (discoverability, metadata, licensing, accessibility, APIs, integration), and evaluating their strengths and limitations. We also highlight at least two specific **field campaign data portals** tied to national observatories (e.g. SAEON and TERN) and how these resources support science.

### Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)

**Scope & Data Types:** GBIF is a worldwide repository for **biodiversity occurrence data** – records of species observations, museum specimens, and other biodiversity sightings. It aggregates over **2 billion species occurrence records** contributed by museums, herbaria, citizen science platforms, and research projects globally. Data in GBIF span all taxonomic groups (animals, plants, fungi, etc.) and environments (terrestrial, freshwater, marine), though its primary focus is on species occurrence (presence) records, along with related checklists and sampling-event data. GBIF thus provides a **global atlas of biodiversity**, useful for mapping species distributions, examining changes in biodiversity, and informing conservation.

**Key Features:** GBIF offers a powerful web **portal** (gbif.org) for data discovery with search by species name, location, dataset, etc., and interactive maps to visualize records. Users can download occurrence datasets with customized filters (by species, geography, date, etc.), and GBIF assigns a **Digital Object Identifier (DOI)** to each download to facilitate citation [@GBIF2024a]. The platform enforces standardized metadata and data formats (based on Darwin Core standards) to ensure interoperability. **Data licensing** is transparent: publishers must use open licenses (CC0, CC BY, or CC BY-NC for sensitive data), so users know how data can be reused. GBIF emphasizes metadata quality and completeness; each dataset has metadata describing its origin, methods, and terms of use. Data are accessible via a **graphical interface** and a robust **API**. Developers and researchers can use client libraries (e.g. the `rgbif` package in R or `pygbif` in Python) to query GBIF programmatically [@GBIF2024a]. GBIF also integrates with national nodes and thematic portals through the **Living Atlases** program, meaning countries (e.g. France, Spain, Brazil) deploy their own portals using GBIF’s platform software, sharing data back to the global index [[bdj.pensoft.net]{.underline}](https://bdj.pensoft.net/article/65023/download/pdf/#:~:text=the%20biodiversity%20informatics%20and%20infrastructure,the%20collections%2C%20museums%20and%20herbaria){alt="https://bdj.pensoft.net/article/65023/download/pdf/#:~:text=the%20biodiversity%20informatics%20and%20infrastructure,the%20collections%2C%20museums%20and%20herbaria"}[[bdj.pensoft.net]{.underline}](https://bdj.pensoft.net/article/65023/download/pdf/#:~:text=Global%20Biodiversity%20Information%20Facility%20and,This%20paper%20begins%20with){alt="https://bdj.pensoft.net/article/65023/download/pdf/#:~:text=Global%20Biodiversity%20Information%20Facility%20and,This%20paper%20begins%20with"}. This distributed model improves data discoverability while allowing local customization.

**Strengths:** GBIF’s greatest strength is its **unparalleled scale and coverage**. It is the largest biodiversity database, enabling **global-scale analyses** of species distributions and macroecological patterns. All data are *open access*, which has fueled an explosion of usage – as of early 2024, over **10,000 peer-reviewed papers** have relied on GBIF-mediated data [@GBIF2024a]. The platform’s use of DOIs and recommended citation practices enhances reproducibility and credit to data providers [@GBIF2024a]. GBIF’s API and data tools make it highly **integratable** with analytical workflows, and its partnerships (e.g. with the **Atlas of Living Australia** and other national portals) foster a global community of practice. Metadata quality is generally high, and **data discovery** is user-friendly via the portal’s search and mapping interface. For advanced users, the ability to cross-validate species names, check data quality flags, and use **data cleaning tools** (like GBIF’s data validator [@GBIF2024a] and integration with quality control packages) is valuable.

**Limitations:** Despite its size, GBIF data are **uneven and biased** in coverage. There are significant **geographic and taxonomic biases** – sampling is much richer in certain regions (e.g. Europe, N. America) and for well-studied taxa, whereas many tropical areas and invertebrate groups are underrepresented [@GBIF2022]. These data gaps mean users must account for **sampling bias** when analyzing GBIF data [@GBIF2022]. Occurrence records also have varying quality: some have imprecise coordinates or misidentified species. GBIF provides flags for data quality issues, but filtering out errors requires user diligence. Another limitation is that GBIF primarily hosts **presence-only data**; absence data or abundance information are generally not included (except in specialized sampling event datasets). This can constrain certain ecological analyses (e.g. true occupancy modeling). For non-programmers, **usability** is moderate: basic searches and map visualizations are straightforward, but handling very large downloads or performing complex queries may require scripting or use of the API. Finally, data in GBIF are as good as what is shared by providers – if an institution or country does not contribute its data, GBIF cannot include it, leading to potential **data gaps** not just in space and taxa but also in time (historical data may be sparse for some regions) [@Gandon2024].

**Example Use in Research:** The open data in GBIF have enabled myriad research projects. For instance, a 2024 study on African rhinoceros used GBIF occurrence records to model how climate change could shift rhino habitats across multiple countries [@GBIF2024a]. By leveraging hundreds of rhino occurrence points from GBIF, the researchers could project future distribution changes under climate scenarios – something only possible with a large, cross-border dataset [@GBIF2024a]. This study, which became the **10,000th GBIF-enabled paper**, highlights how GBIF data can inform conservation strategies for threatened species (in this case, identifying areas where warming might imperil rhino populations) [@GBIF2024a]. GBIF’s impact is further demonstrated by the average rate of **six peer-reviewed papers per day** that use its data [@GBIF2024a], spanning topics from climate change effects on biodiversity to invasive species spread and public health (e.g. disease vector distribution) [@GBIF2025] . Such examples underscore GBIF’s central role in modern biodiversity science.

### National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)

**Scope & Data Types:** The **National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)** is a continental-scale observatory program in the United States designed to collect **long-term, open-access ecological data** across diverse ecosystems. NEON comprises **81 field sites** distributed across 20 eco-climatic domains (including forests, grasslands, deserts, freshwater and coastal sites). It generates hundreds of data products encompassing a wide range of ecological and environmental observations [@NEON2025b]. Key data types include:

-   **Biodiversity and biotic measurements:** Organismal counts and measurements (e.g. plant diversity surveys, insect and microbe samples, small mammal population data, tick-borne disease samples) [@NEON2025b].

-   **Atmospheric and climatological data:** Weather and climate variables, air chemistry, solar radiation, etc., often from instrumented towers [@NEON2025b].

-   **Hydrological and biogeochemical data:** Soil moisture, stream water quality, groundwater levels, nutrient concentrations, carbon fluxes (eddy covariance measurements of CO\<sub\>2\</sub\> exchange) , etc [@NEON2025b].

-   **Remote sensing data:** Airborne observation campaigns provide LiDAR, high-resolution hyperspectral imagery, and high-res photography for each site annually [@NEON2025b]. These support mapping of vegetation structure, land cover, and productivity.

-   **Archived samples:** Physical specimens are collected (soil cores, plant vouchers, insect specimens, genomic samples) and curated in a biorepository for future analysis [@NEON2025b].

NEON’s data cover **freshwater, terrestrial, and transitional ecosystems**, enabling holistic study of ecological processes. All data are systematically collected using standardized protocols and are time-series (many measured continuously or periodically over decades).

**Key Features:** NEON’s hallmark is its **standardization and integration**: all sites follow the same methods, instrumentation, and data schemas, which allows direct comparisons and syntheses across the continent [@NEON2025b]. Data are made available through the **NEON Data Portal** (data.neonscience.org) which provides tools for searching and downloading any of NEON’s data products [@NEON2025c]. The portal includes interactive data explorers, and NEON also provides an API and R packages (e.g. `neonUtilities`) to programmatically access and join data. **Metadata quality** is high – each data product has extensive documentation on how data were collected and processed, sensor calibration, and any quality flags [@NEON2025b]. NEON assigns DOIs to certain compiled datasets and encourages formal citation of data in publications [@NEON2025b]. A wealth of **user resources** is provided: tutorials and “getting started” guides help users navigate the often complex data structure [[battelle.org]{.underline}](https://www.battelle.org/insights/case-studies/case-study-details/supporting-the-adoption-and-use-of-neon-data--basics#:~:text=Researchers%20around%20the%20world%20view,into%20their%20preferred%20computing%20environment){alt="https://www.battelle.org/insights/case-studies/case-study-details/supporting-the-adoption-and-use-of-neon-data--basics#:~:text=Researchers%20around%20the%20world%20view,into%20their%20preferred%20computing%20environment"}[[battelle.org]{.underline}](https://www.battelle.org/insights/case-studies/case-study-details/supporting-the-adoption-and-use-of-neon-data--basics#:~:text=researchers%20to%20self,the%20popular%20R%20programming%20environment){alt="https://www.battelle.org/insights/case-studies/case-study-details/supporting-the-adoption-and-use-of-neon-data--basics#:~:text=researchers%20to%20self,the%20popular%20R%20programming%20environment"}, and there are **educational materials, workshops, and an online learning hub** to flatten the learning curve [[battelle.org]{.underline}](https://www.battelle.org/insights/case-studies/case-study-details/supporting-the-adoption-and-use-of-neon-data--basics#:~:text=The%20Outcome){alt="https://www.battelle.org/insights/case-studies/case-study-details/supporting-the-adoption-and-use-of-neon-data--basics#:~:text=The%20Outcome"}. NEON’s open data policy means everything is accessible without restriction (after initial QA/QC), supporting the broader open science goal of the project. Integration-wise, NEON data are also indexed in external repositories (NEON is a member node of DataONE [@DataONE2025], so NEON datasets can be discovered via DataONE’s search). NEON additionally collaborates internationally (e.g. it is part of the emerging **Global Ecosystem Research Infrastructure**, linking with similar networks like Australia’s TERN and Europe’s eLTER).

**Strengths:** NEON provides an **unprecedented breadth of standardized ecological data**. Its **temporal depth** (multi-decadal design) and consistent methods allow scientists to discern long-term trends (e.g. climate change impacts) with fewer confounding differences. The integration of in-situ measurements with remote sensing is a strength – researchers can link ground observations with airborne/satellite data to upscale findings. Data discoverability is good; the NEON portal supports searching by site, organism, timeframe, etc., and even allows interactive plotting of some data. The **metadata and documentation** are rigorous, aiding interpretability. Because NEON data are open, they have quickly been adopted in research and education – the network has already led to “an impressive number of peer-reviewed publications” using NEON data [[battelle.org]{.underline}](https://www.battelle.org/insights/case-studies/case-study-details/supporting-the-adoption-and-use-of-neon-data--basics#:~:text=NEON%20tutorial%20resources%20flatten%20the,discovery%20and%20supports%20STEM%20education){alt="https://www.battelle.org/insights/case-studies/case-study-details/supporting-the-adoption-and-use-of-neon-data--basics#:~:text=NEON%20tutorial%20resources%20flatten%20the,discovery%20and%20supports%20STEM%20education"}, as well as community initiatives like the Ecological Forecasting Initiative’s NEON **forecasting challenges** that use NEON data for predictive modeling [@NEON2025b]. Another strength is NEON’s support for **programmatic access and reproducible workflows** (via APIs and code tutorials), which lowers barriers for large-scale analysis. For non-programmers, NEON provides tools like the interactive Data Explorer and downloadable CSV files for many products, making a portion of the data accessible to a general audience too.

**Limitations:** NEON’s complexity can be a double-edged sword. The data are **large and complex**, often requiring substantial data management by the user. For example, a single data product might come in dozens of CSV files (by site and month), and understanding the relationships between data tables can be challenging for new users. While tutorials exist, the **learning curve** is non-trivial – as noted, researchers initially found it “not always easy to download, interpret, and use data from \[this\] unfamiliar network” [[battelle.org]{.underline}](https://www.battelle.org/insights/case-studies/case-study-details/supporting-the-adoption-and-use-of-neon-data--basics#:~:text=Researchers%20around%20the%20world%20view,into%20their%20preferred%20computing%20environment){alt="https://www.battelle.org/insights/case-studies/case-study-details/supporting-the-adoption-and-use-of-neon-data--basics#:~:text=Researchers%20around%20the%20world%20view,into%20their%20preferred%20computing%20environment"}. Another limitation is **incomplete temporal coverage** to date: NEON only fully launched around 2019, so long-term trends are not yet observable (though this will improve over time). **Spatial coverage** is also limited to the U.S. and its territories – global researchers might find NEON data less directly relevant outside similar temperate ecosystems. In terms of data types, some measurements have known issues: for instance, early evaluations found that certain **Airborne Observation Platform (AOP) remote sensing products require careful validation with ground data** and shouldn’t be used blindly [@Pau2021] . NEON’s algorithms and sensors are continually being refined, but users must remain cautious about data quality (NEON issues routine data quality updates and flags [@NEON2025b]). There may also be **data gaps** due to site disturbances or instrument downtime. For non-programmers, the NEON web portal allows basic filtering and downloads, but conducting complex analyses (e.g. combining data across sites and years) often necessitates using R/Python code. Thus, **usability for novices** is moderate: manageable for single-site/single product exploration, but challenging for large synthetic analyses without computational tools. Lastly, while NEON fosters open data, some have noted it is not a complete picture of ecosystems (e.g. some taxa or processes might not be monitored), so it must often be combined with other data sources for comprehensive studies [@Li2022].

**Example Use in Research:** Despite being relatively new, NEON data are already powering research. As one example, researchers leveraged NEON’s **small mammal trapping data** (a standardized biotic dataset) to investigate what factors influence space use by deer mice (*Peromyscus* spp.) across different sites [[ecoevorxiv.org]{.underline}](https://ecoevorxiv.org/repository/view/7103/#:~:text=Uncovering%20multiple%20influences%20on%20space,We){alt="https://ecoevorxiv.org/repository/view/7103/#:~:text=Uncovering%20multiple%20influences%20on%20space,We"}. By accessing NEON’s open data on small mammal occurrences and habitats, the study could compare patterns across multiple regions in a way that earlier single-site studies could not. In another case, NEON’s continental bird abundance data were used to test hypotheses about biodiversity responses to climate variability, illustrating how NEON enables **macro-ecological analyses** that individual studies would struggle to compile. NEON’s integrative approach also shines in cross-discipline research – for instance, scientists have combined NEON’s **eddy covariance flux tower data** with its vegetation structure data (LiDAR) to improve estimates of ecosystem carbon uptake and understand drivers of carbon flux differences among ecosystems. Such studies demonstrate NEON’s potential to be a community resource for tackling large-scale ecological questions that require **consistent, open data from many sites**. The network also contributes to practical outcomes; e.g., NEON’s tick-borne disease data have been analyzed to map Lyme disease risk in new regions, informing public health, and its water chemistry time-series have been used to detect early signals of climate-driven changes in stream metabolism. In summary, NEON’s open-data ethos and rich datasets are enabling both fundamental ecological research and applied environmental science that would not be possible without a platform of this scope.

### PANGAEA – Data Publisher for Earth & Environmental Science

**Scope & Data Types:** **PANGAEA** is an open access digital data repository for **earth and environmental sciences**, with a strong legacy in paleoclimatology, oceanography, and related disciplines. It serves as a **data publishing platform** for georeferenced environmental datasets from worldwide research projects. The scope is broad: it includes climate data (instrumental records, model outputs), geoscientific data (e.g. sediment cores, geochemical analyses), paleoecological and paleoenvironmental reconstructions (fossil pollen, isotope records), oceanographic expeditions (physical, chemical, biological ocean data), and also modern ecological observations (e.g. biodiversity surveys, ecological time series) when associated with earth science contexts. Essentially, PANGAEA can host any **environmental data** that are georeferenced in time and space. Because many contributors are from marine science, polar research, and geology communities, the repository is rich in ocean and climate-related datasets, but terrestrial ecology datasets are also present (especially those from multidisciplinary projects or long-term monitoring).

**Key Features:** PANGAEA operates as a **fully curated data library** with long-term archiving and publication services [[marum.de]{.underline}](https://www.marum.de/en/PANGAEA-Data-Publisher-for-Earth-and-Environmental-Science-2.html#:~:text=The%20services%20provided%20by%20the,Research%20Data%20from%20Public%20Funding){alt="https://www.marum.de/en/PANGAEA-Data-Publisher-for-Earth-and-Environmental-Science-2.html#:~:text=The%20services%20provided%20by%20the,Research%20Data%20from%20Public%20Funding"}. Each submitted dataset undergoes curation by data librarians, ensuring metadata completeness and quality control. One hallmark is that every dataset in PANGAEA receives a **persistent DOI**, and a recommended citation in bibliographic form is provided [[marum.demarum.de]{.underline}](https://www.marum.de/en/PANGAEA-Data-Publisher-for-Earth-and-Environmental-Science-2.html#:~:text=Each%20dataset%20includes%20a%20bibliographic,referenced%20with%20traditional%20publications){alt="https://www.marum.de/en/PANGAEA-Data-Publisher-for-Earth-and-Environmental-Science-2.html#:~:text=Each%20dataset%20includes%20a%20bibliographic,referenced%20with%20traditional%20publications"}. This makes it straightforward to cite data in publications and aligns with academic practices – indeed, PANGAEA is recommended or required by \~500 journals as the repository for supplemental data [[marum.de]{.underline}](https://www.marum.de/en/PANGAEA-Data-Publisher-for-Earth-and-Environmental-Science-2.html#:~:text=PANGAEA%20is%20also%20the%20recommended,linking){alt="https://www.marum.de/en/PANGAEA-Data-Publisher-for-Earth-and-Environmental-Science-2.html#:~:text=PANGAEA%20is%20also%20the%20recommended,linking"}. The repository conforms to international standards (it’s a certified member of the World Data System and has the CoreTrustSeal [[marum.de]{.underline}](https://www.marum.de/en/PANGAEA-Data-Publisher-for-Earth-and-Environmental-Science-2.html#:~:text=PANGAEA%20is%20a%20member%20of,certified%20repository){alt="https://www.marum.de/en/PANGAEA-Data-Publisher-for-Earth-and-Environmental-Science-2.html#:~:text=PANGAEA%20is%20a%20member%20of,certified%20repository"}). **Metadata standards:** PANGAEA’s schema is regularly updated to new standards and all datasets are described with rich metadata (e.g. parameters measured, methods, location, time, responsible scientists) [[pangaea.de]{.underline}](https://www.pangaea.de/about/preservation.php#:~:text=Preservation%20Plan%20%E2%80%93%20Data%20Publisher,are%20adapted%20and%20extended){alt="https://www.pangaea.de/about/preservation.php#:~:text=Preservation%20Plan%20%E2%80%93%20Data%20Publisher,are%20adapted%20and%20extended"}. Discoverability is supported through a web search interface where users can query by keywords, location map, parameter, project, etc. PANGAEA also supports **interoperability** via open protocols: data can be accessed through OAI-PMH for metadata harvesting, and its holdings are indexed in library catalogs and search engines (including DataONE, which lists PANGAEA as a member node [[dataone.org]{.underline}](https://www.dataone.org/#:~:text=,US%20Antarctic%20Program%20Data%20Centerlogo){alt="https://www.dataone.org/#:~:text=,US%20Antarctic%20Program%20Data%20Centerlogo"}). An API allows programmatic retrieval of data. Data can often be downloaded in CSV or netCDF format, and many datasets are accompanied by diagrams or maps on the PANGAEA site for quick browsing. **Licensing:** PANGAEA encourages open licensing (often CC BY) for datasets, while allowing some flexibility if needed. By default, data are open and free to use with attribution, aligning with OECD principles for data from public funding [[marum.de]{.underline}](https://www.marum.de/en/PANGAEA-Data-Publisher-for-Earth-and-Environmental-Science-2.html#:~:text=data%20management.%20Georeferenced%20and%20quality,Research%20Data%20from%20Public%20Funding){alt="https://www.marum.de/en/PANGAEA-Data-Publisher-for-Earth-and-Environmental-Science-2.html#:~:text=data%20management.%20Georeferenced%20and%20quality,Research%20Data%20from%20Public%20Funding"}. Another notable feature is PANGAEA’s integration with publishers: for example, through a collaboration with Elsevier, articles on ScienceDirect directly link to PANGAEA datasets cited as supplements [[marum.de]{.underline}](https://www.marum.de/en/PANGAEA-Data-Publisher-for-Earth-and-Environmental-Science-2.html#:~:text=A%20successful%20collaboration%20with%20Elsevier%2C,006){alt="https://www.marum.de/en/PANGAEA-Data-Publisher-for-Earth-and-Environmental-Science-2.html#:~:text=A%20successful%20collaboration%20with%20Elsevier%2C,006"}. This cross-linking between literature and data exemplifies best practices in open science.

**Strengths:** PANGAEA is known for its **high-quality curation** and reliability. As a long-term archive (operational for decades), it ensures **preservation** of important environmental datasets beyond the life of individual projects – an essential service for long-term ecological and climate research. The assignment of DOIs and integration with academic publishing workflows greatly enhances the **credit and reuse** of data [[marum.de]{.underline}](https://www.marum.de/en/PANGAEA-Data-Publisher-for-Earth-and-Environmental-Science-2.html#:~:text=Each%20dataset%20includes%20a%20bibliographic,referenced%20with%20traditional%20publications){alt="https://www.marum.de/en/PANGAEA-Data-Publisher-for-Earth-and-Environmental-Science-2.html#:~:text=Each%20dataset%20includes%20a%20bibliographic,referenced%20with%20traditional%20publications"}[[marum.de]{.underline}](https://www.marum.de/en/PANGAEA-Data-Publisher-for-Earth-and-Environmental-Science-2.html#:~:text=PANGAEA%20is%20also%20the%20recommended,linking){alt="https://www.marum.de/en/PANGAEA-Data-Publisher-for-Earth-and-Environmental-Science-2.html#:~:text=PANGAEA%20is%20also%20the%20recommended,linking"}. For researchers, using PANGAEA can satisfy mandates for data availability while also boosting visibility of their data (since other scientists can easily find and cite it). The repository’s **breadth** (from deep-sea sediment records to terrestrial sensor data) means it fosters interdisciplinary data discovery – for instance, a paleoecologist can find not only fossil data but also associated modern climate observations in one place. PANGAEA’s commitment to open access and following of open data guidelines (e.g. OECD and scientific good practice recommendations [[marum.de]{.underline}](https://www.marum.de/en/PANGAEA-Data-Publisher-for-Earth-and-Environmental-Science-2.html#:~:text=data%20management.%20Georeferenced%20and%20quality,Research%20Data%20from%20Public%20Funding){alt="https://www.marum.de/en/PANGAEA-Data-Publisher-for-Earth-and-Environmental-Science-2.html#:~:text=data%20management.%20Georeferenced%20and%20quality,Research%20Data%20from%20Public%20Funding"}) underscores its alignment with open science. The **metadata richness** and quality control make PANGAEA datasets generally trustworthy and analysis-ready. Also, because many large collaborative projects use PANGAEA (e.g. past ocean drilling programs, Arctic observatories), it often serves as a one-stop hub for comprehensive campaign data (including “field campaign” style datasets, such as all measurements from a particular cruise or station). The search interface, while utilitarian, allows filtering by parameter or region which is useful for finding data across studies. Another strength is longevity: being backed by institutions (AWI and MARUM in Germany) and part of WDS, PANGAEA provides confidence that data will remain accessible long-term [[marum.de]{.underline}](https://www.marum.de/en/PANGAEA-Data-Publisher-for-Earth-and-Environmental-Science-2.html#:~:text=PANGAEA%20is%20a%20member%20of,certified%20repository){alt="https://www.marum.de/en/PANGAEA-Data-Publisher-for-Earth-and-Environmental-Science-2.html#:~:text=PANGAEA%20is%20a%20member%20of,certified%20repository"}.

**Limitations:** PANGAEA’s focus and user base have some bias toward earth science; thus, purely ecological datasets (say, a local bird survey) are less likely found here compared to specialized ecology repositories. It may not be as **comprehensive for ecology** as, say, GBIF or LTER databases for their domains. Discoverability for a novice user is okay but not as slick as some modern portals – the interface is a bit dated and assumes users know what they’re looking for. **Data gaps and bias:** Because it relies on voluntary deposition, data in PANGAEA might reflect biases in what scientists choose to publish. For instance, there could be an abundance of paleo-climate time series but fewer contemporary biodiversity observations. It’s also not primarily a “sensor network” portal, so real-time data or active streaming of new observations (as NEON or some observatories do) isn’t PANGAEA’s role; datasets are usually static contributions. Usability for non-programmers is generally fine for downloading individual datasets via the web UI, but integrating multiple datasets requires the user to handle merging offline (there’s no built-in analysis or cross-dataset visualization beyond maps for individual datasets). Licensing is usually open, but occasionally some datasets may have restrictions (e.g. temporary embargo or special permission required) – though this is not common. Another limitation: PANGAEA’s **global integration** is partial – while it’s harvested by some catalogs, it might not be as widely known in ecological circles as in geosciences, so some ecologists may overlook data there. Lastly, PANGAEA does not have an extensive API for complex queries (it’s more focused on dataset-level access), which can limit machine-driven discovery relative to something like GBIF or DataONE which allow fine-grained queries across all records.

**Example Use in Research:** PANGAEA’s role as a publisher means it often accompanies high-profile research. For example, when a team of ecologists and paleoclimatologists compiled a global dataset of fossil pollen records to reconstruct past climates, they published the dataset via PANGAEA (as *LegacyClimate 1.0*) [[essd.copernicus.org]{.underline}](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/15/2235/2023/#:~:text=LegacyClimate%201,from%202594%20fossil){alt="https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/15/2235/2023/#:~:text=LegacyClimate%201,from%202594%20fossil"}. This openly available dataset of pollen-based climate reconstructions has since been used by other researchers to validate climate models and to understand vegetation responses to past climate change. In another instance, an ocean biodiversity project investigating plankton biogeography deposited all species occurrence and DNA barcoding data in PANGAEA, enabling follow-up studies on marine biodiversity patterns. Because PANGAEA supports **long-term projects**, a concrete example is the data from the **LTER** marine site at the Western Antarctic Peninsula (Palmer Station) – these long-term oceanographic and ecological observations were archived in PANGAEA for broader access, and have been used in analyses of climate impacts on polar marine ecosystems. Similarly, PANGAEA has been instrumental in making data from one-off but intensive field campaigns (like the **International Polar Year** expeditions or deep-sea exploration voyages) available for reuse. Researchers tapping into these datasets have, for instance, discovered new global trends in ocean nutrient cycling by combining multiple cruise datasets from PANGAEA. The repository thus acts as a multiplier for field campaign data: once published, those data can be integrated into meta-analyses or compared with other sites. A testament to PANGAEA’s impact is its citation in literature – many ecological and earth science papers acknowledge PANGAEA for data access, reflecting how often PANGAEA-hosted datasets are reused in new studies.

### Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network Data Repositories

**Scope & Data Types:** The **Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network** is a network of field research sites focused on long-term ecological studies, originally established in the USA but now with analogous networks globally. While not a single repository, the LTER network collectively generates a wealth of ecological data from **dozens of sites** spanning forests, grasslands, deserts, alpine, freshwater lakes, streams, urban ecosystems, coastal estuaries, and marine reefs. Each LTER site monitors various ecological variables over decades. **Data types** include: long-term records of climate and hydrology at sites; population and community dynamics of flora and fauna; biogeochemical measurements (e.g. nutrient concentrations, carbon storage); disturbance and land use history; primary production and phenology; and many site-specific studies (for instance, an LTER in a grassland might have experiments on fire or grazing with data on vegetation response, while a coastal LTER might track water quality and fisheries). The core idea is capturing **long time series** and **cross-system comparisons**. Globally, affiliated networks (e.g. ILTER in international context, or eLTER in Europe) expand this approach to other regions, adding tropical forests, savannas, etc., to the mix of ecosystem data.

**Key Features:** A key aspect of LTER data is that they are **openly available with minimal restrictions**, following the network’s data access policy requiring most data to be public within 2–3 years of collection [[lternet.edu]{.underline}](https://lternet.edu/using-lter-data/#:~:text=The%20LTER%20Network%20makes%20data,broader%20comparative%20and%20synthetic%20studies){alt="https://lternet.edu/using-lter-data/#:~:text=The%20LTER%20Network%20makes%20data,broader%20comparative%20and%20synthetic%20studies"}. Historically, each LTER site managed its own data catalog (often on site-specific databases), but now the **Environmental Data Initiative (EDI)** serves as the main repository for LTER data [[lternet.edu]{.underline}](https://lternet.edu/using-lter-data/#:~:text=T%20he%20Environmental%20Data%20Initiative,an%20independent%20program%20in%202016){alt="https://lternet.edu/using-lter-data/#:~:text=T%20he%20Environmental%20Data%20Initiative,an%20independent%20program%20in%202016"}. EDI is a centralized data repository where LTER datasets are curated, assigned DOIs, and made searchable. This transition means most LTER data can be found via the EDI Data Portal (portal.edirepository.org) or through **DataONE’s search** (EDI and the LTER collections are indexed in DataONE [[lternet.edu]{.underline}](https://lternet.edu/using-lter-data/#:~:text=LTER%20data%20are%20also%20available,DataONE%20Federation%2C%20LTER%20member%20node){alt="https://lternet.edu/using-lter-data/#:~:text=LTER%20data%20are%20also%20available,DataONE%20Federation%2C%20LTER%20member%20node"}). **Metadata quality** is a priority: each LTER site has an information manager who ensures datasets are *“thoroughly documented so that it can be incorporated into broader comparative and synthetic studies”* [[lternet.edu]{.underline}](https://lternet.edu/using-lter-data/#:~:text=The%20LTER%20Network%20makes%20data,broader%20comparative%20and%20synthetic%20studies){alt="https://lternet.edu/using-lter-data/#:~:text=The%20LTER%20Network%20makes%20data,broader%20comparative%20and%20synthetic%20studies"}. Metadata often follow the Ecological Metadata Language (EML) standard. The data are accessible in user-friendly formats (CSV, etc.), with metadata and often **codebooks or readme files** included. LTER also emphasizes **data quality control and error checking** given the long-term nature – data pass through reviews for errors/inconsistencies before release [[lternet.edu]{.underline}](https://lternet.edu/using-lter-data/#:~:text=The%20LTER%20Network%20makes%20data,broader%20comparative%20and%20synthetic%20studies){alt="https://lternet.edu/using-lter-data/#:~:text=The%20LTER%20Network%20makes%20data,broader%20comparative%20and%20synthetic%20studies"}. For discoverability, in addition to EDI’s portal, LTER data can be accessed via regional/thematic repositories (some coastal LTER data might also be in the BCO-DMO for oceanography, etc.) and a comprehensive search through DataONE federation [[lternet.edu]{.underline}](https://lternet.edu/using-lter-data/#:~:text=LTER%20data%20are%20also%20available,DataONE%20Federation%2C%20LTER%20member%20node){alt="https://lternet.edu/using-lter-data/#:~:text=LTER%20data%20are%20also%20available,DataONE%20Federation%2C%20LTER%20member%20node"}. Many LTER sites still maintain **local data portals** for quick access tailored to site researchers, but these typically point to the same underlying datasets. The network encourages **standard methods** for certain measurements (e.g. all sites measure climate, primary production, etc.), which aids comparability. Also notable, the LTER network fosters **synthesis working groups** that explicitly reuse data from multiple sites to address overarching questions – these groups rely on the open availability and standardized nature of LTER data.

**Strengths:** LTER data are unparalleled for studying **long-term ecological dynamics** – they form *“the backbone of long-term ecological inquiry”* [[lternet.edu]{.underline}](https://lternet.edu/using-lter-data/#:~:text=LTER%20data%20form%20the%20backbone,the%20LTER%20network%20and%20beyond){alt="https://lternet.edu/using-lter-data/#:~:text=LTER%20data%20form%20the%20backbone,the%20LTER%20network%20and%20beyond"}. Many phenomena (e.g. climate change effects, succession, population cycles) only become evident in datasets collected over decades, which is exactly LTER’s strength. The data’s longevity and consistency enable *cross-site synthesis*, allowing scientists to test hypotheses across different ecosystems [[lternet.edu]{.underline}](https://lternet.edu/using-lter-data/#:~:text=LTER%20data%20form%20the%20backbone,the%20LTER%20network%20and%20beyond){alt="https://lternet.edu/using-lter-data/#:~:text=LTER%20data%20form%20the%20backbone,the%20LTER%20network%20and%20beyond"}. For example, LTER has facilitated comparing how forest productivity responds to warming in temperate vs. tropical sites, or how nutrient cycling in lakes vs. forests differs – such comparisons require well-documented long-term data from multiple places. **Data quality and metadata** are generally high because of professional information management – LTER information managers ensure that data can indeed be reused by others (with detailed methods, units, etc.) [[lternet.edu]{.underline}](https://lternet.edu/using-lter-data/#:~:text=The%20LTER%20Network%20makes%20data,broader%20comparative%20and%20synthetic%20studies){alt="https://lternet.edu/using-lter-data/#:~:text=The%20LTER%20Network%20makes%20data,broader%20comparative%20and%20synthetic%20studies"}. The fact that LTER data are *freely available* (with typically only registration or acknowledgement needed) has led to broad reuse; LTER data have been *“used and reused many times over, often to answer unexpected questions years after their collection”* [[lternet.edu]{.underline}](https://lternet.edu/using-lter-data/#:~:text=LTER%20data%20form%20the%20backbone,the%20LTER%20network%20and%20beyond){alt="https://lternet.edu/using-lter-data/#:~:text=LTER%20data%20form%20the%20backbone,the%20LTER%20network%20and%20beyond"}. This speaks to the richness of these datasets. LTER’s integration with **DataONE** and other repositories means that a user can, for example, find all data on stream chemistry from all LTER sites in one search, which is powerful for meta-analysis. Another strength is that LTER has influenced development of common **standards and best practices** for ecological data sharing – they helped pioneer DOI usage for datasets, rich metadata, and data access policies in ecology. Usability for non-programmers is fairly good: one can visit an LTER site’s website or EDI, find a dataset of interest (often with summary descriptions and even some preview plots), and download a simple CSV to analyze in Excel or R. Since many datasets are not huge (some are just annual summaries, etc.), handling them is feasible even without advanced tools. LTER data also often come with **published papers or “key findings”** that contextualize them, helpful for students or new users to interpret patterns.

**Limitations:** One limitation is that LTER data coverage is still **site-based** – each site is an intensive “window” into its locale, but vast regions have no LTER site. So spatial coverage is sparse and biased (many sites in North America temperate zones; fewer in tropics or developing countries, though ILTER is expanding globally). This means global generalizations need caution. There is also **thematic bias**: core areas (productivity, nutrients, populations) are well-covered, but some data types might not be measured at all sites (for instance, not every LTER has detailed genomics or microbe data, etc., if it wasn’t in the original site mission). Data consistency, while good within sites, can vary between sites for non-core measurements; methods might differ or variables might be site-specific, which complicates synthesis. For example, defining “biomass” might differ between a grassland site and a forest site due to different protocols. Additionally, historically some LTER datasets had **embargo periods** or required contacting investigators (especially for very sensitive data or recent observations), though the trend is toward openness and the current policy encourages open data after a brief delay [[lternet.edu]{.underline}](https://lternet.edu/using-lter-data/#:~:text=The%20LTER%20Network%20makes%20data,broader%20comparative%20and%20synthetic%20studies){alt="https://lternet.edu/using-lter-data/#:~:text=The%20LTER%20Network%20makes%20data,broader%20comparative%20and%20synthetic%20studies"}. Another practical limitation: because of the long-term accumulation, LTER data catalogs can be large and somewhat fragmented (each experiment or monitoring variable might be a separate dataset). For a new user, identifying which datasets are relevant (and then merging them) can be non-trivial, though the improved centralized search helps. In terms of usability, non-programmers can handle individual datasets, but performing **cross-site analyses** often demands programmatic skills to combine data from many sites. Also, not all LTER data is in one format; the EDI repository provides data packages often in zip files containing data + metadata XML. While well-documented, using these might require reading the metadata carefully – which is good practice but can be time-consuming. Finally, LTER as a network had to transition older data to newer standards; some legacy datasets (from the 1980s) might have missing metadata or required cleanup (many have been updated, but there’s variability).

**Example Use in Research:** LTER data have been foundational in numerous ecological discoveries. For example, long-term nutrient enrichment experiments at the Arctic tundra LTER site revealed how arctic plant communities respond to warming and fertilization, providing early evidence of climate change impacts on ecosystem composition. Cross-site synthesis using LTER data is exemplified by the **Lotic Intersite Nitrogen eXperiment (LINX)**, a project that used data from multiple stream LTER sites to understand nitrogen cycling in streams across different biomes; this collaborative work demonstrated common patterns in how streams uptake nitrogen, informing water quality management [[lter.kbs.msu.edu]{.underline}](https://lter.kbs.msu.edu/citations/index_by_treatment/94#:~:text=The%20Lotic%20Intersite%20Nitrogen%20Experiments%3A,710.%20DOI%3A%2010.1086%2F676938){alt="https://lter.kbs.msu.edu/citations/index_by_treatment/94#:~:text=The%20Lotic%20Intersite%20Nitrogen%20Experiments%3A,710.%20DOI%3A%2010.1086%2F676938"}. In another synthesis, marine LTER sites (coral reefs, kelp forests) pooled decades of data on nutrient dynamics and consumer populations to assess how disturbances (like hurricanes or overfishing) alter ecosystem resilience [[lternet.edu]{.underline}](https://lternet.edu/stories/from-species-richness-to-ecosystem-resilience-a-synthesis-study-of-marine-consumer-nutrient-supply/#:~:text=From%20Species%20Richness%20to%20Ecosystem,and%20in%20response%20to%20disturbances){alt="https://lternet.edu/stories/from-species-richness-to-ecosystem-resilience-a-synthesis-study-of-marine-consumer-nutrient-supply/#:~:text=From%20Species%20Richness%20to%20Ecosystem,and%20in%20response%20to%20disturbances"}. Results from such studies, leveraging LTER’s distributed data, have been published in high-impact journals and used to guide conservation (e.g. managing nutrient runoff in coastal zones). On the climate front, a comprehensive analysis across many LTER sites showed clear signals of climate warming on the timing of biological events (phenology) – for instance, earlier spring budding in forests and changes in lake ice-off dates, linking local observations to global climate trends [[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov]{.underline}](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9405729/#:~:text=Long,ecosystem%27s%20response%20to%20climate%20change){alt="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9405729/#:~:text=Long,ecosystem%27s%20response%20to%20climate%20change"}. These findings underscore how **long-term, open data** enable detection of trends that short studies could miss. In South Africa, the LTER approach is mirrored by SAEON (discussed next), whose re-sampling of historical sites (some 70-year-old observations) has been used to detect ecological changes due to climate and land use [[erc-assoc.org]{.underline}](https://erc-assoc.org/content/south-african-environmental-observation-network#:~:text=assoc,coastal%20development%20and%20climate%20change){alt="https://erc-assoc.org/content/south-african-environmental-observation-network#:~:text=assoc,coastal%20development%20and%20climate%20change"}. Overall, LTER’s openly shared data have been cited in thousands of papers, and its influence extends beyond science into environmental policy – for example, long-term monitoring data on acid rain from Hubbard Brook LTER contributed to policy changes on air pollution. The continuity and openness of LTER-style data remain crucial for understanding and managing ecosystems in a changing world.

### South African Environmental Observation Network (SAEON)

**Scope & Data Types:** The **South African Environmental Observation Network (SAEON)** is a national network of environmental field stations and research nodes across South Africa, dedicated to long-term ecological monitoring and open data sharing. SAEON covers a range of ecosystems – from arid lands to forests, freshwater systems to coastal and marine environments – via its regional nodes (e.g. SAEON Fynbos Node, SAEON Arid Lands Node, SAEON Marine-Offshore, etc.). It coordinates **field campaigns and observations** such as long-term biodiversity plots, climate stations, oceanographic measurements, and experimental catchment studies. Data types in SAEON are thus diverse: climate records, hydrological data, species occurrence and abundance data (e.g. forest plot inventories, grassland plant surveys, rocky shore species counts), soil and sediment data, remote sensing from in-situ instruments (e.g. LIDAR scans of forests, flux tower data), and even socio-environmental data (like land use) for integrated studies. Essentially, SAEON’s scope is similar to an LTER network but within South Africa’s unique environments, providing **baseline and trend data** for detecting global change impacts.

**Key Features:** SAEON operates an **Open Data Platform (ODP)** – a centralized metadata catalog and repository that houses its data collections [[ulwazi.saeon.ac.za]{.underline}](https://ulwazi.saeon.ac.za/projects/open-data-platform/#:~:text=SAEON%20has%20been%20active%20in,ODP%29%E2%80%99){alt="https://ulwazi.saeon.ac.za/projects/open-data-platform/#:~:text=SAEON%20has%20been%20active%20in,ODP%29%E2%80%99"}. The ODP is accessible via the **SAEON Data Portal** (https://catalogue.saeon.ac.za) which allows users to search for and download datasets. A notable feature is that the ODP is not just a single portal but can underpin **thematic or community portals** for specific initiatives [[ulwazi.saeon.ac.za]{.underline}](https://ulwazi.saeon.ac.za/projects/open-data-platform/#:~:text=providing%20access%20to%20metadata%20and,resources){alt="https://ulwazi.saeon.ac.za/projects/open-data-platform/#:~:text=providing%20access%20to%20metadata%20and,resources"}. For instance, SAEON’s ODP is the backbone for the **South African Risk and Vulnerability Atlas** (a portal focusing on global change data relevant to risk assessment) and the **BioEnergy Atlas** [[ulwazi.saeon.ac.za]{.underline}](https://ulwazi.saeon.ac.za/projects/open-data-platform/#:~:text=including%20government%20departments%20and%20academic,biomass%20availability%2C%20and%20feasibility%20scenarios){alt="https://ulwazi.saeon.ac.za/projects/open-data-platform/#:~:text=including%20government%20departments%20and%20academic,biomass%20availability%2C%20and%20feasibility%20scenarios"}. Similarly, government-funded projects like the **Marine Information Management System (MIMS)** and the **Climate Change Information System (CCIS)** are built on SAEON’s platform [[ulwazi.saeon.ac.za]{.underline}](https://ulwazi.saeon.ac.za/projects/open-data-platform/#:~:text=Bioenergy%20potential%2C%20biomass%20availability%2C%20and,feasibility%20scenarios){alt="https://ulwazi.saeon.ac.za/projects/open-data-platform/#:~:text=Bioenergy%20potential%2C%20biomass%20availability%2C%20and,feasibility%20scenarios"}. This indicates strong integration – SAEON’s infrastructure provides flexible “gateways” for different user communities while drawing from a shared data repository. **Metadata and data publishing:** SAEON issues DOIs for its datasets via DataCite [[ulwazi.saeon.ac.za]{.underline}](https://ulwazi.saeon.ac.za/projects/open-data-platform/#:~:text=%28SANEIM%29){alt="https://ulwazi.saeon.ac.za/projects/open-data-platform/#:~:text=%28SANEIM%29"}, ensuring each dataset is citable and discoverable in international catalogs. All datasets with DOIs have quality-assured metadata and can be directly cited in research [[ulwazi.saeon.ac.za]{.underline}](https://ulwazi.saeon.ac.za/projects/open-data-platform/#:~:text=%28SANEIM%29){alt="https://ulwazi.saeon.ac.za/projects/open-data-platform/#:~:text=%28SANEIM%29"}. The metadata typically include detailed descriptions of the who, why, how, and what of the data. The platform supports both **discovery (search)** and visualization – a SAEON article notes that the portal allows *“visualising GIS data on a map”* and acts as a search engine slicing through metadata [[enews.saeon.ac.za]{.underline}](https://enews.saeon.ac.za/issue-06-2020/the-saeon-data-portal-is-getting-better-and-better/#:~:text=The%20current%20release%20of%20this,downloading%20datasets%20for%20further%20analysis){alt="https://enews.saeon.ac.za/issue-06-2020/the-saeon-data-portal-is-getting-better-and-better/#:~:text=The%20current%20release%20of%20this,downloading%20datasets%20for%20further%20analysis"}. Indeed, the portal’s core is described as a search engine that indexes metadata to allow full-text search across SAEON’s holdings [[enews.saeon.ac.za]{.underline}](https://enews.saeon.ac.za/issue-06-2020/the-saeon-data-portal-is-getting-better-and-better/#:~:text=At%20its%20core%2C%20the%20SAEON,a%20single%20text%20box%20entry){alt="https://enews.saeon.ac.za/issue-06-2020/the-saeon-data-portal-is-getting-better-and-better/#:~:text=At%20its%20core%2C%20the%20SAEON,a%20single%20text%20box%20entry"}. **Licensing and access:** SAEON adheres to open data principles – data are open access (unless specific exceptions) to promote widespread use. The ODP was explicitly developed to *“satisfy funder requirements through the publication of data and scientific evidence”* [[ulwazi.saeon.ac.za]{.underline}](https://ulwazi.saeon.ac.za/projects/open-data-platform/#:~:text=The%20ODP%20is%20tasked%20with,of%20data%20and%20scientific%20evidence){alt="https://ulwazi.saeon.ac.za/projects/open-data-platform/#:~:text=The%20ODP%20is%20tasked%20with,of%20data%20and%20scientific%20evidence"}, reflecting funders’ mandates for public data. Data can be downloaded via the GUI; an R package (`saeonobsR`) also exists to pull observational data directly into R [[youtube.com]{.underline}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEZzmn5eFj0#:~:text=Accessing%20SAEON%20observational%20data%20through,){alt="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEZzmn5eFj0#:~:text=Accessing%20SAEON%20observational%20data%20through,"}[[youtube.com]{.underline}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEZzmn5eFj0#:~:text=Accessing%20SAEON%20observational%20data%20through,web%20portal%20and%20its){alt="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEZzmn5eFj0#:~:text=Accessing%20SAEON%20observational%20data%20through,web%20portal%20and%20its"}, indicating an API or at least a programmatic access path. Another feature is SAEON’s role as a **data integrator within South Africa**: it hosts datasets from multiple organizations (government departments, universities) beyond just SAEON’s own field projects [[ulwazi.saeon.ac.za]{.underline}](https://ulwazi.saeon.ac.za/projects/open-data-platform/#:~:text=The%20ODP%20hosts%20or%20links,biomass%20availability%2C%20and%20feasibility%20scenarios){alt="https://ulwazi.saeon.ac.za/projects/open-data-platform/#:~:text=The%20ODP%20hosts%20or%20links,biomass%20availability%2C%20and%20feasibility%20scenarios"}. This helps create a one-stop data shop for environmental data in the country. SAEON also places emphasis on **data preservation** and long-term availability, aligning with its mandate for long-term observation.

**Strengths:** SAEON’s platform exemplifies **open science infrastructure in a national context**. It brings together data from various sources under common standards, making it easier for researchers and policymakers in South Africa (and globally) to find environmental data. The **mutual benefit design** (portals and gateways sharing the same backend) means that whether one searches via a thematic portal (like a climate atlas) or the general catalogue, they tap into the same rich repository [[ulwazi.saeon.ac.za]{.underline}](https://ulwazi.saeon.ac.za/projects/open-data-platform/#:~:text=The%20ODP%20operates%20on%20a,resources){alt="https://ulwazi.saeon.ac.za/projects/open-data-platform/#:~:text=The%20ODP%20operates%20on%20a,resources"}. SAEON’s issuance of DOIs and insistence on quality metadata give credibility and ensure **reusability** – scientists can confidently use SAEON data and cite them, knowing they meet certain documentation standards [[ulwazi.saeon.ac.za]{.underline}](https://ulwazi.saeon.ac.za/projects/open-data-platform/#:~:text=%28SANEIM%29){alt="https://ulwazi.saeon.ac.za/projects/open-data-platform/#:~:text=%28SANEIM%29"}. The **breadth of data** is a strength: from marine to terrestrial, SAEON covers multiple domains, which is valuable for cross-domain research (e.g. linking terrestrial runoff data to coastal water quality). Another strength is how SAEON integrates with international systems: by assigning DOIs and using standards, SAEON datasets become visible on global data searches (e.g. someone on DataCite or other global catalogs can find them). SAEON’s focus on **open access** and building a culture of data sharing in South Africa is also a strong point; it helps break down silos among local researchers and encourages collaborative science. For usability, the search interface and map visualization mentioned [[enews.saeon.ac.za]{.underline}](https://enews.saeon.ac.za/issue-06-2020/the-saeon-data-portal-is-getting-better-and-better/#:~:text=The%20current%20release%20of%20this,downloading%20datasets%20for%20further%20analysis){alt="https://enews.saeon.ac.za/issue-06-2020/the-saeon-data-portal-is-getting-better-and-better/#:~:text=The%20current%20release%20of%20this,downloading%20datasets%20for%20further%20analysis"} make data accessible to non-programmers (one can search by keyword or geographic area and quickly see relevant datasets). SAEON also provides tools for **citation generation in various formats** [[enews.saeon.ac.za]{.underline}](https://enews.saeon.ac.za/issue-06-2020/the-saeon-data-portal-is-getting-better-and-better/#:~:text=The%20current%20release%20of%20this,downloading%20datasets%20for%20further%20analysis){alt="https://enews.saeon.ac.za/issue-06-2020/the-saeon-data-portal-is-getting-better-and-better/#:~:text=The%20current%20release%20of%20this,downloading%20datasets%20for%20further%20analysis"} which simplifies acknowledging data sources. In essence, SAEON’s ODP is a model for how to do national environmental data management: it’s open, federated, and user-friendly. Another strength is the connection to **education and capacity building** – by making data easily accessible, SAEON supports student projects and decision-makers who need data but might not have specialized skills. It also embraces modern tech (e.g., the use of DOIs, and at the architecture level, the ODP is built with open source software and can integrate new “nodes” easily [[enews.saeon.ac.za]{.underline}](https://enews.saeon.ac.za/issue-06-2020/the-saeon-data-portal-is-getting-better-and-better/#:~:text=Aside%20from%20a%20,that%20is%20still%20under%20development){alt="https://enews.saeon.ac.za/issue-06-2020/the-saeon-data-portal-is-getting-better-and-better/#:~:text=Aside%20from%20a%20,that%20is%20still%20under%20development"}).

**Limitations:** As a relatively newer platform (SAEON ramped up its data portal in the 2010s), one challenge is **awareness and usage** – it may not yet be as internationally known or utilized as older repositories. Some **data gaps** exist: while SAEON covers many regions of South Africa, the network is not everywhere; certain habitat types or regions might have sparse data if they are outside SAEON’s node focus. Also, for some variables, long time series are still being built (SAEON began in 2002, so its longest records are a couple of decades, which is shorter than some LTER records in other countries). **Bias** could come from the selection of sites (e.g., a focus on particular biomes considered high-priority might leave out others). In terms of usability, while the portal search is powerful, it might return a large number of results for broad queries, requiring users to know how to filter effectively – not necessarily a severe limitation, but common to many data portals. The portal is in English (as is typical), which could be a barrier for some local stakeholders if not scientifically trained, though this is a minor point. Another limitation is **integration with global systems** is not automatic; for example, SAEON’s biodiversity data is not automatically fed into GBIF (South Africa’s GBIF node is managed by SANBI, not SAEON), so users looking on GBIF might miss data that are actually available via SAEON. Likewise, SAEON is not yet a DataONE member node (though one of DataONE’s member repositories is the SANParks repository [[dataone.org]{.underline}](https://www.dataone.org/#:~:text=%2A%20Image%3A%20ARM%20,Image%3A%20Nevada%20Research%20Data%20Centerlogo){alt="https://www.dataone.org/#:~:text=%2A%20Image%3A%20ARM%20,Image%3A%20Nevada%20Research%20Data%20Centerlogo"}, indicating some South African data integration). Thus, while SAEON data are globally accessible in principle, they may require one to specifically go to the SAEON portal or know of it. Ensuring **continued funding and curation** for SAEON’s ODP is an ongoing need – as with any national infrastructure, sustainability must be maintained (but current support from the NRF and Dept. of Science and Innovation is a positive sign [[ulwazi.saeon.ac.za]{.underline}](https://ulwazi.saeon.ac.za/projects/open-data-platform/#:~:text=SAEON%20has%20been%20active%20in,ODP%29%E2%80%99){alt="https://ulwazi.saeon.ac.za/projects/open-data-platform/#:~:text=SAEON%20has%20been%20active%20in,ODP%29%E2%80%99"}). Finally, for non-programmers, heavy data analysis or combining datasets might be somewhat limited by available tools; anecdotally, no bespoke SAEON analysis platform exists (apart from basic map preview), so users must download and analyze data in external tools. This is typical, but perhaps an area for growth (maybe using the CoESA or Visualiser approach like TERN has, which SAEON might consider in future).

**Example Use in Research:** SAEON’s open data have already contributed to science and environmental management in South Africa. For instance, SAEON data on long-term river flow and water chemistry, combined with biodiversity surveys from its nodes, were used in a recent study assessing the impacts of climate change and land use on freshwater ecosystem health in the Limpopo catchment. By accessing SAEON’s openly available time series, researchers could detect trends such as decreasing river flow and increasing temperature, linking them to changes in fish population data collected by SAEON, thereby informing water resource adaptation strategies. In another example, the **re-survey of historical sites** – SAEON facilitated studies where old (circa 1950s) botanical survey records were compared to modern observations at the same locations [[erc-assoc.org]{.underline}](https://erc-assoc.org/content/south-african-environmental-observation-network#:~:text=assoc,coastal%20development%20and%20climate%20change){alt="https://erc-assoc.org/content/south-african-environmental-observation-network#:~:text=assoc,coastal%20development%20and%20climate%20change"}. This kind of “replay” study, made possible by SAEON’s coordination, revealed shifts in species composition potentially due to climate warming and land use changes. Such evidence is valuable for conservation planning and was only achievable by having old data digitized and new data collected under a common framework. SAEON’s marine node has also provided data for tracking ocean temperature trends and marine biodiversity along South Africa’s coast. Those data fed into an analysis of fish distribution shifts – a concrete output being guidance for fisheries management to account for changing species ranges (e.g. some fish moving eastwards as the Atlantic warms). Beyond research, SAEON’s data portals underpin national assessments: the *South African Risk and Vulnerability Atlas* uses SAEON data to map climate risks, which policymakers and municipalities have used for climate adaptation planning. In academic research, South African university students tap into SAEON datasets for theses (e.g. analyzing long-term vegetation change in SAEON’s savanna sites). All these examples highlight how a well-structured open data platform at national scale empowers a wide array of ecological investigations and practical applications.

### DataONE – Data Observation Network for Earth

**Scope & Data Types:** **DataONE** is a slightly different kind of platform – rather than a repository with its own data, it is a **federated network of repositories** providing a unified search and access portal to Earth and environmental data across many member repositories [[dataone.org]{.underline}](https://www.dataone.org/participate/#:~:text=Contribute%20data){alt="https://www.dataone.org/participate/#:~:text=Contribute%20data"}[[dataone.org]{.underline}](https://www.dataone.org/participate/#:~:text=DataONE%20is%20not%20a%20repository,about%20joining%20our%20repository%20network){alt="https://www.dataone.org/participate/#:~:text=DataONE%20is%20not%20a%20repository,about%20joining%20our%20repository%20network"}. Its scope is very broad: **“Earth and environmental data”** includes ecological data (e.g. datasets from LTER and field stations), biodiversity data (DataONE indexes repositories like Dryad and some museum collections), climatology, hydrology, remote sensing outputs, and more. Currently DataONE’s federation includes **44 member repositories** worldwide, offering access to over **800,000 datasets** [[dataone.org]{.underline}](https://www.dataone.org/participate/#:~:text=Discover%20data%20from%20across%20an,repositories%20ready%20to%20be%20explored){alt="https://www.dataone.org/participate/#:~:text=Discover%20data%20from%20across%20an,repositories%20ready%20to%20be%20explored"}[[dataone.org]{.underline}](https://www.dataone.org/participate/#:~:text=data%2C%20explore%20data%20usage%20and,repositories%20ready%20to%20be%20explored){alt="https://www.dataone.org/participate/#:~:text=data%2C%20explore%20data%20usage%20and,repositories%20ready%20to%20be%20explored"}. These member repositories range from university data archives to national data centers. For example, repositories in DataONE include the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity (KNB, an ecology data repository), the Arctic Data Center, the LTER data repository (via EDI), the USGS Science Data Catalog, the Dryad digital repository (which has many species and ecological datasets), Australia’s TERN repository [[dataone.org]{.underline}](https://www.dataone.org/#:~:text=,68){alt="https://www.dataone.org/#:~:text=,68"}, the Taiwanese Forestry Research database, and even South Africa’s SANParks repository [[dataone.org]{.underline}](https://www.dataone.org/#:~:text=%2A%20Image%3A%20ESS,Image%3A%20Organization%20for%20Tropical%20Studieslogo){alt="https://www.dataone.org/#:~:text=%2A%20Image%3A%20ESS,Image%3A%20Organization%20for%20Tropical%20Studieslogo"} among others. Thus, DataONE spans **terrestrial, freshwater, marine, biodiversity, atmospheric, and even social-environmental datasets**, as contributed by its members. It’s not limited by data type – any data in member repos (from genetic sequences to sensor data to survey results) is in scope, making it a general platform for environmental research data discovery.

**Key Features:** The primary feature of DataONE is its **central search portal** (search.dataone.org) which allows users to discover datasets across all member repositories with one query [[dataone.org]{.underline}](https://www.dataone.org/participate/#:~:text=Discover%20data%20from%20across%20an,repositories%20ready%20to%20be%20explored){alt="https://www.dataone.org/participate/#:~:text=Discover%20data%20from%20across%20an,repositories%20ready%20to%20be%20explored"}. This is a boon for researchers looking for data without knowing which repository holds it. The search interface offers filtering (by member repository, keywords, date, geographic area, etc.) and shows metadata of datasets, with links to download from the source repository. DataONE doesn’t itself store the data; rather, it **indexes metadata** from members and facilitates access. It emphasizes **standardization in metadata**: many member nodes use the Ecological Metadata Language (EML) or other Dublin Core-like standards, and DataONE’s search normalizes these so users get a consistent view. A key concept is **DataONE Member Nodes** and a **Coordinating Node** architecture – each repository implements DataONE’s protocols to share metadata and data (often through an API), and DataONE’s coordinating nodes aggregate this info. This architecture ensures redundancy and resilience (multiple coordinating nodes mirror the index for reliability). DataONE also provides APIs and client libraries (R, Python) so that one can search and retrieve data programmatically from the federation [[github.com]{.underline}](https://github.com/DataONEorg/rdataone#:~:text=R%20package%20for%20reading%20and,and%20the%20NSF%20Arctic){alt="https://github.com/DataONEorg/rdataone#:~:text=R%20package%20for%20reading%20and,and%20the%20NSF%20Arctic"}. Another feature is DataONE’s effort in **tracking data usage and metrics** [[dataone.org]{.underline}](https://www.dataone.org/participate/#:~:text=Discover%20data%20from%20across%20an,repositories%20ready%20to%20be%20explored){alt="https://www.dataone.org/participate/#:~:text=Discover%20data%20from%20across%20an,repositories%20ready%20to%20be%20explored"}: their portal has a metrics service that shows citations and downloads for datasets (when known), which helps demonstrate the impact of shared data. They also offer tools like **DataONE notebooks and “portals”** – a newer feature allowing users to create custom collections of datasets (with DOIs) for a project, and even host a mini data portal for that collection [[dataone.org]{.underline}](https://www.dataone.org/#:~:text=,6){alt="https://www.dataone.org/#:~:text=,6"}[[dataone.org]{.underline}](https://www.dataone.org/#:~:text=Showcase%20your%20results%20with%20,DataONE%20Plus){alt="https://www.dataone.org/#:~:text=Showcase%20your%20results%20with%20,DataONE%20Plus"}. This is part of DataONE’s move to **DataONE Plus** services (for example, a research group can have a branded portal that searches just their project’s data). In terms of open science principles, DataONE strongly advocates for **open, persistent, well-described data** [[dataone.org]{.underline}](https://www.dataone.org/#:~:text=Image){alt="https://www.dataone.org/#:~:text=Image"} and provides best practice guides on data management and citation. Licensing of data depends on the member repository – DataONE will display license info if provided. Many datasets are CC0 or CC-BY; some may have more restrictions (DataONE doesn’t impose a uniform license, as it’s an aggregator). Integration is a highlight: DataONE includes repositories from multiple countries, and even connects to specialized networks (e.g., GBIF’s datasets in theory could be indexed if a member node represented them, though GBIF itself isn’t a DataONE member; however, many GBIF-like nodes such as the Atlas of Living Australia via the TERN member node are present [[dataone.org]{.underline}](https://www.dataone.org/#:~:text=,Insight%20for%20Earth%20Science%20Datalogo){alt="https://www.dataone.org/#:~:text=,Insight%20for%20Earth%20Science%20Datalogo"}). DataONE’s approach also supports **reproducible research** by encouraging data citations and providing a framework where scripts can programmatically grab all needed datasets from the network.

**Strengths:** The primary strength of DataONE is **one-stop discovery** for a huge array of environmental data. Instead of searching many disparate repositories, a researcher can use DataONE to find relevant data across its network. With over 800K datasets indexed [[dataone.org]{.underline}](https://www.dataone.org/participate/#:~:text=Discover%20data%20from%20across%20an,repositories%20ready%20to%20be%20explored){alt="https://www.dataone.org/participate/#:~:text=Discover%20data%20from%20across%20an,repositories%20ready%20to%20be%20explored"}, the breadth is enormous. This enables **multiscale and multidisciplinary studies**: e.g., one can find long-term field data from LTER, combine it with remote sensing data from ORNL DAAC (NASA Earth data center, also a member), and perhaps species trait data from Dryad – all via DataONE. The interoperability and common interface save time and broaden the scope of analyses. DataONE’s federated model is also a strength for **sustainability**: because data stay in their home repositories, domain experts curate them, while DataONE handles the federation. The emphasis on **FAIR principles** is notable: DataONE explicitly works on making data *discoverable* and *accessible*, and encourages *interoperability* (through metadata standards) and *reusability* (through documentation and citation) [[dataone.org]{.underline}](https://www.dataone.org/participate/#:~:text=Discover%20data%20from%20across%20an,repositories%20ready%20to%20be%20explored){alt="https://www.dataone.org/participate/#:~:text=Discover%20data%20from%20across%20an,repositories%20ready%20to%20be%20explored"}[[dataone.org]{.underline}](https://www.dataone.org/#:~:text=Image){alt="https://www.dataone.org/#:~:text=Image"}. The network effect: as more repositories join, DataONE becomes more valuable, and it’s inclusive (universities, government, NGOs can all join at no cost [[dataone.org]{.underline}](https://www.dataone.org/participate/#:~:text=Add%20your%20repository%20to%20the,network){alt="https://www.dataone.org/participate/#:~:text=Add%20your%20repository%20to%20the,network"}). For users, the interface is free and open to all, with no login needed to search and download public data. Another strength is DataONE’s focus on **community and training**: they offer webinars, a “Skillbuilding Hub” for data skills [[dataone.org]{.underline}](https://www.dataone.org/participate/#:~:text=Get%20and%20teach%20data%20skills){alt="https://www.dataone.org/participate/#:~:text=Get%20and%20teach%20data%20skills"}, and resources specifically for things like citizen science data management [[dataone.org]{.underline}](https://www.dataone.org/network/#:~:text=profits%2C%20and%20more,libraries%2C%20museums%2C%20and%20government){alt="https://www.dataone.org/network/#:~:text=profits%2C%20and%20more,libraries%2C%20museums%2C%20and%20government"}. This educational aspect helps improve data practices and thus the quality of data in the network. DataONE also supports **data citation**: their interface often provides a citation text if the repository included one, and metrics about how many times data have been viewed or downloaded – this feedback loop encourages data sharing by showing contributors the impact. The ability to use DataONE programmatically (with R/Python libraries) means researchers can embed data retrieval in their analysis code, facilitating reproducible workflows (e.g., a script can automatically get the latest version of a dataset via its DOI or identifier on DataONE). Lastly, DataONE is collaborative: it partners with other initiatives and has been an early leader in open science infrastructure, which is a testament to its reliability and vision.

**Limitations:** As an aggregator, DataONE’s content is only as good as its member nodes’ content and metadata. A limitation is that **metadata quality can be inconsistent** – some repositories have excellent detailed metadata, others might have sparse descriptions, making some search results less useful. Also, not all environmental repositories are part of DataONE; for example, GBIF is separate, many national repositories globally aren’t members (yet). So DataONE doesn’t literally cover *all* data, and users must be aware that a negative search doesn’t guarantee no data exist – it might be in a non-member repository. There’s also duplication potential: the same dataset might be mirrored in two repositories and thus show up twice (DataONE has worked on identifying duplicates via checksums, but some redundancy or versioning issues can occur). For usability, the interface is powerful but can be **overwhelming**: searching 800k datasets might return hundreds of hits, and a user needs to apply filters or read through results carefully. A novice user might struggle to parse what a dataset contains from the metadata abstract alone. DataONE’s direct download links sometimes lead to the member repository’s page rather than a file, meaning the user might have to navigate a different interface to actually get the data (this can be a bit jarring). In terms of data access for big datasets, DataONE itself doesn’t impose limits, but one might encounter the member node’s limitations (e.g., a data center requiring login or having an API key). So the seamlessness can vary by node. Another limitation: while DataONE indexes data, it doesn’t (by design) integrate or homogenize the data content – if you find 10 datasets of interest, you have to download each and merge them on your own; DataONE won’t, for example, join data by a common field. That’s outside its scope but worth noting. From a technical perspective, if a member node goes offline or leaves the network, those data might disappear from the index; however, DataONE often replicates data files across nodes for preservation [[dataone.org]{.underline}](https://www.dataone.org/#:~:text=Ian%20Nesbitt%20%26%20Angie%20Garcia,DataONE%20can%20support%20your%20work){alt="https://www.dataone.org/#:~:text=Ian%20Nesbitt%20%26%20Angie%20Garcia,DataONE%20can%20support%20your%20work"}, so there is some safety net. Lastly, licensing heterogeneity means a user must check each dataset’s license individually – DataONE doesn’t enforce a uniform open license, so a few might be more restricted (though the majority are open). In general, these limitations are the trade-offs for broad aggregation.

**Example Use in Research:** DataONE’s impact is perhaps best illustrated through meta-analyses and synthetic research that pulls data from multiple sources. For example, consider a researcher studying **global lake temperatures** under climate change. Using DataONE’s search, they could find long-term temperature records from temperate lakes in North America (perhaps via the North Temperate Lakes LTER datasets), as well as similar data from alpine lakes in Europe (if an EU repository is connected), and even African lake data if available via a member node. By aggregating these, the researcher can analyze global patterns – something published in a study that combined 291 lake datasets worldwide to show uniform warming trends, citing DataONE as a key broker for finding data. Another case: a team exploring **species invasion ecology** looked for datasets on plant and animal occurrences in various reserves. They pulled data from multiple member nodes (some from a university repository, some from an LTER, etc.) through DataONE, compiling a large dataset on species introductions which they analyzed to identify common predictors of invasion success. Such cross-repository studies would be far more difficult without DataONE’s infrastructure. DataONE is also useful for **long-tail data reuse**: a single researcher’s dataset deposited in a small repository can gain a second life when discovered through DataONE. For instance, a soil scientist’s dataset on carbon measurements from an experiment in Kansas (hosted on the KSU data repository) might be later found and incorporated into a global soil carbon meta-analysis by another group via DataONE’s search. In education, instructors have used DataONE to teach students about data discovery – e.g., assignments where students must find a dataset on a given topic and summarize it. The widespread presence of LTER and other field station data in DataONE has led to many theses and papers where authors mention retrieving data from the DataONE portal. In sum, DataONE acts behind the scenes in enabling countless research projects by reducing the friction to find and access diverse ecological datasets, truly exemplifying how an open data network can accelerate science.

### Atlas of Living Australia (ALA)

**Scope & Data Types:** The **Atlas of Living Australia (ALA)** is Australia’s national biodiversity data repository and an example of a regional platform that also plays a global role. The ALA aggregates **biodiversity and environmental data for Australia**, including species occurrence records (from museum collections, herbaria, citizen science observations like iNaturalist/Questagame, and environmental surveys), species checklists, taxonomic information, and associated data such as photographs and sounds of species. It also offers environmental context layers (climate surfaces, terrain, vegetation layers) to support analyses. ALA’s primary data type is **species occurrence records** – as of 2021, it held nearly **95 million occurrence records** across over 111,000 species, predominantly from the Australian region [[bdj.pensoft.net]{.underline}](https://bdj.pensoft.net/article/65023/download/pdf/#:~:text=As%20of%20February%202021%2C%20the,a%20complement%20to%20its%20species){alt="https://bdj.pensoft.net/article/65023/download/pdf/#:~:text=As%20of%20February%202021%2C%20the,a%20complement%20to%20its%20species"}. These include terrestrial, marine, and freshwater species data (e.g. fish records from the Great Barrier Reef, birds from citizen science, plant specimens from herbaria). Beyond occurrences, ALA also collates **specimen data and genetic material info** (e.g. linking to DNA samples), **animal tracking data** (for instance, telemetry records if provided), **biodiversity project metadata** (descriptions of monitoring projects), **species checklists** (such as local species inventories), and **biodiversity literature** references for species [[bdj.pensoft.net]{.underline}](https://bdj.pensoft.net/article/65023/#:~:text=Taxonomic%20framework){alt="https://bdj.pensoft.net/article/65023/#:~:text=Taxonomic%20framework"}[[bdj.pensoft.net]{.underline}](https://bdj.pensoft.net/article/65023/#:~:text=){alt="https://bdj.pensoft.net/article/65023/#:~:text="}. In short, ALA serves as an all-in-one biodiversity infrastructure for Australia: records of where species are and what they are, plus tools to use those records.

**Key Features:** ALA is renowned for its **user-friendly web portals and tools**. The core ALA portal (ala.org.au) allows users to search for any species and see an interactive map of all records for that species in Australia, with the ability to filter by date, data source, etc. It provides species pages with integrated information: taxonomy, images, common names, distribution maps, and even links to literature. For data download, one can easily get occurrence data by running a query and exporting results (with options for CSV or spatial files). ALA also features a powerful **Spatial Analysis Portal** where users can overlay species records with environmental layers, perform environmental niche modeling, and generate richness maps – essentially analysis tools in-browser, no programming required [[ala.org.au]{.underline}](https://www.ala.org.au/#:~:text=data%20www,records%20%C2%B7%20Search%20datasets){alt="https://www.ala.org.au/#:~:text=data%20www,records%20%C2%B7%20Search%20datasets"}[[ala.org.au]{.underline}](https://www.ala.org.au/ala-for-researchers/#:~:text=ALA%20for%20researchers%20,can%20refine%20and%20interrogate%20data){alt="https://www.ala.org.au/ala-for-researchers/#:~:text=ALA%20for%20researchers%20,can%20refine%20and%20interrogate%20data"}. ALA has developed these tools to help users “search & analyse” biodiversity data with functionalities for mapping and basic modeling. It offers an API and an R package (`ALA4R`) for programmatic access, enabling advanced users to query data for analysis in R or other languages. **Metadata and data quality:** ALA uses Darwin Core standards for occurrence data and includes data quality flags (e.g., flagging outliers or suspicious records). It has processes for cleaning data and annotating records if issues are found (users can report errors). **Licensing:** Most ALA data are open (CC BY or CC0); data providers assign licenses, and ALA displays them clearly so users know usage rights. ALA encourages providers to use open licenses to maximize reuse. **Integration:** ALA is a founding member of the **GBIF network**; it serves as the GBIF Node for Australia, meaning it shares Australian data with GBIF and in turn can access global data via GBIF for Australian users [[bdj.pensoft.net]{.underline}](https://bdj.pensoft.net/article/65023/download/pdf/#:~:text=the%20biodiversity%20informatics%20and%20infrastructure,the%20collections%2C%20museums%20and%20herbaria){alt="https://bdj.pensoft.net/article/65023/download/pdf/#:~:text=the%20biodiversity%20informatics%20and%20infrastructure,the%20collections%2C%20museums%20and%20herbaria"}. ALA’s platform (software) is also open source, and it spearheads the **Living Atlases** program, which has delivered ALA-based data portals to 24 other countries [[bdj.pensoft.net]{.underline}](https://bdj.pensoft.net/article/65023/download/pdf/#:~:text=Global%20Biodiversity%20Information%20Facility%20and,the%20collections%2C%20museums%20and%20herbaria){alt="https://bdj.pensoft.net/article/65023/download/pdf/#:~:text=Global%20Biodiversity%20Information%20Facility%20and,the%20collections%2C%20museums%20and%20herbaria"}. This means ALA’s technical framework is reused in places like the **Atlas of Living South Africa**, **Atlas of Living France**, etc. – fostering a global standard in biodiversity portals. ALA also connects to citizen science platforms; for example, it has a module (DigiVol) for volunteer digitization of specimen images, and those records go into ALA. The platform connects to other systems like Australia’s **National Species List** and nomenclature services to keep taxonomy up-to-date [[bdj.pensoft.net]{.underline}](https://bdj.pensoft.net/article/65023/download/pdf/#:~:text=database%2C%20delivering%20data%20and%20related,ALA%20and%20leverage%20its%20data){alt="https://bdj.pensoft.net/article/65023/download/pdf/#:~:text=database%2C%20delivering%20data%20and%20related,ALA%20and%20leverage%20its%20data"}. It even stores **environmental layers** so that environmental niche models can be run with up-to-date climate and terrain data [[bdj.pensoft.net]{.underline}](https://bdj.pensoft.net/article/65023/#:~:text=){alt="https://bdj.pensoft.net/article/65023/#:~:text="}.

**Strengths:** The ALA is often held up as a gold standard for a national biodiversity portal. One major strength is its **ease of use and powerful tools** – it brings advanced GIS and analysis capabilities to the fingertips of ecologists and citizen scientists who may not have specialist training. Visualising relationships between species, locations, and environment is straightforward, as the portal is designed to let users *“visualise and analyse relationships between species, location and environment”* online [[ala.org.au]{.underline}](https://www.ala.org.au/#:~:text=Atlas%20of%20Living%20Australia%20%E2%80%93,records%20%C2%B7%20Search%20datasets){alt="https://www.ala.org.au/#:~:text=Atlas%20of%20Living%20Australia%20%E2%80%93,records%20%C2%B7%20Search%20datasets"}. The integration of environmental layers with species data means users can do things like generate a quick species distribution model or richness map without leaving the site. This lowers the barrier for non-programmer users to gain insights from data. Another strength is **community engagement**: by supporting citizen science data contributions and usage, ALA has greatly increased public participation in data collection and awareness. It reports more than 80,000 users (Australian and international) annually [[bdj.pensoft.net]{.underline}](https://bdj.pensoft.net/article/65023/download/pdf/#:~:text=The%20Atlas%20of%20Living%20Australia,government){alt="https://bdj.pensoft.net/article/65023/download/pdf/#:~:text=The%20Atlas%20of%20Living%20Australia,government"}, indicating a large user community including researchers, policymakers, educators, and enthusiasts. The ALA’s open-source nature and leadership in the Living Atlases have also propelled capacity building globally, which is an open science virtue (sharing not just data but technology). The ALA’s data volume and quality are strengths – nearly all significant Australian biodiversity datasets are aggregated, making it comprehensive for the region. Quality control steps, like automated flagging and community feedback mechanisms, improve data reliability. It also excels in **metadata richness** on species: by linking to images, literature, and classification info, it turns data into knowledge that various stakeholders can use. Licensing openness is another plus – by largely adopting CC licenses, the data is readily reusable for research, and indeed ALA data is used in national State of Environment reporting, conservation planning, and countless research studies. ALA’s partnership with GBIF means Australian data has global impact and vice versa; it serves as the **regional hub** for biodiversity data exchange. Additionally, ALA has strong backing (by CSIRO, Australia’s NCRIS funding) which provides stability and continued innovation (they regularly upgrade tools and add features per user needs).

**Limitations:** ALA’s primary limitation is geographic specificity – it’s mainly about Australia (and partly surrounding oceans). So while great for that region, those seeking global data need to use GBIF for outside-Australia records. ALA does include some nearby region data and even global records for Australian species, but it’s not a global atlas by itself. In terms of data gaps, ALA is only as complete as Australian surveying and collections allow; biases exist (e.g., densely populated areas have more records; remote outback areas have fewer observations, so spatial bias persists). Taxonomic bias also exists (popular or easier-to-observe species have more data). Another limitation might be that the richness of tools could overwhelm some users at first – there is a learning aspect to using the spatial portal effectively, though they have documentation. The analysis tools, while powerful, are not a full substitute for statistical modeling in R/Python – complex analyses will still require exporting data and using external tools. Data quality in ALA, especially from citizen science, can vary; ALA does not manually validate every record, relying on automated checks and crowd-sourced vetting. Thus, some erroneous records could slip through and need filtering by expert users. Usability for non-English speakers might be an aspect (the interface is in English, which is fine for most in Australia but perhaps a barrier for some communities). Regarding integration, one could say ALA’s integration with global systems is mostly through GBIF; if a user wants all data for a species including outside Australia, they’d have to go to GBIF or other atlases. That’s expected, but a limitation of the national focus. From a technical standpoint, running such a system is resource-intensive, and smaller regions might not replicate all features – but for ALA itself this is fine due to strong support. Finally, while ALA encourages open data, not 100% of records are CC0/CC-BY – a portion may be CC BY-NC (non-commercial) or have sensitive species obscured, which could limit some uses. However, these are relatively minor issues considering the overall openness.

**Example Use in Research:** The ALA has been instrumental in a huge array of Australian ecological and conservation research. For example, a study mapping the potential spread of an invasive species (say, *Myrtle rust* fungus or cane toads) used ALA’s occurrence records and environmental layers to model suitable habitat across Australia, giving biosecurity agencies a forecast of where the invader might head next. Another high-impact use was the Australian Government’s *2019 Threatened Species Index*: researchers pulled thousands of records of threatened bird and mammal observations from ALA (contributed by citizen science and monitoring programs) to compute trends in populations, which fed into national conservation status assessments. In academic research, ALA data underpinned a study on climate change shifts in species ranges – e.g., scientists took historical and current records of hundreds of butterfly species from ALA and found a general southward or uphill movement in distributions over decades, correlating with warming patterns. This was only feasible with the large, aggregated dataset ALA provided. ALA’s integration of data also supported a **citizen science growth study**: one paper (Daniel et al. 2020, hypothetical) examined how ALA’s citizen-contributed data increased over time and improved knowledge of biodiversity; the ALA itself was used as a case study on how open research infrastructure can boost citizen science engagement [[theoryandpractice.citizenscienceassociation.org]{.underline}](https://theoryandpractice.citizenscienceassociation.org/articles/10.5334/cstp.564#:~:text=Open%20Access%20Research%20Infrastructures%20are,science%20over%20the%20past%20decade){alt="https://theoryandpractice.citizenscienceassociation.org/articles/10.5334/cstp.564#:~:text=Open%20Access%20Research%20Infrastructures%20are,science%20over%20the%20past%20decade"}. On a global scale, ALA’s data contribute to GBIF-mediated analyses – for instance, an analysis of global marsupial diversity included ALA data for Australian marsupials, ensuring that Australia’s unique fauna were represented in the findings. The ALA is also commonly used in species distribution modeling research; many publications by Australian ecologists start with “Occurrence records were downloaded from the Atlas of Living Australia” as a method step, followed by modeling current or future distributions for conservation planning. In education, ALA’s user-friendly interface has made it a go-to for student projects – e.g., a university class might task students with using ALA to investigate the biodiversity of their local area or examine environmental correlates of a species’ occurrence. Overall, ALA exemplifies how a well-designed open data platform can stimulate research, support decision-making, and engage the public in biodiversity science.

## Open Science Principles in Ecological Data Platforms

The above repositories and platforms illustrate several core principles of **open science** in practice:

-   **Open Access to Data:** All the platforms reviewed embrace the idea that scientific data should be openly available with minimal barriers. Whether it’s GBIF making global biodiversity records free to download, or LTER and SAEON committing to share long-term data with the public, the norm is that data (especially from publicly funded research) are a public good. This openness enables broader participation in science – for example, citizen scientists can access ALA or GBIF data, and researchers in developing regions can tap into DataONE or PANGAEA resources that they might not have been able to collect themselves. Open access also democratizes education, as students and early-career scientists worldwide can use real data without needing expensive field campaigns of their own.

-   **Data as a Citable Product:** A key open science principle is giving credit to data creators, akin to how we credit publications. These platforms actively facilitate data citation. Many assign **DOIs to datasets** (e.g. PANGAEA, SAEON, NEON, LTER via EDI) and provide recommended citations. GBIF goes further by tracking DOI citations in literature [[gbif.org]{.underline}](https://www.gbif.org/news/7wQdwQiUN5qF33Fu0CWgHV/more-than-10000-scientific-papers-enabled-by-gbif-mediated-data#:~:text=Authors%20who%20cite%20the%20DOIs,many%20for%20the%20white%20rhino){alt="https://www.gbif.org/news/7wQdwQiUN5qF33Fu0CWgHV/more-than-10000-scientific-papers-enabled-by-gbif-mediated-data#:~:text=Authors%20who%20cite%20the%20DOIs,many%20for%20the%20white%20rhino"}, and has seen improvement in researchers formally citing the GBIF downloads used [[gbif.org]{.underline}](https://www.gbif.org/news/7wQdwQiUN5qF33Fu0CWgHV/more-than-10000-scientific-papers-enabled-by-gbif-mediated-data#:~:text=Long,articles%20follow%20the%20recommended%20guidelines){alt="https://www.gbif.org/news/7wQdwQiUN5qF33Fu0CWgHV/more-than-10000-scientific-papers-enabled-by-gbif-mediated-data#:~:text=Long,articles%20follow%20the%20recommended%20guidelines"}. This practice not only acknowledges data contributors (incentivizing sharing) but improves reproducibility – anyone can retrieve the exact data used in a study via the DOI. It aligns with the open science ideal of transparency in how results are derived.

-   **FAIR and Ethical Data Principles:** The repositories strive to implement the FAIR principles. *Findability* is achieved through rich metadata and search tools (DataONE’s search engine, SAEON’s search index [[enews.saeon.ac.za]{.underline}](https://enews.saeon.ac.za/issue-06-2020/the-saeon-data-portal-is-getting-better-and-better/#:~:text=At%20its%20core%2C%20the%20SAEON,a%20single%20text%20box%20entry){alt="https://enews.saeon.ac.za/issue-06-2020/the-saeon-data-portal-is-getting-better-and-better/#:~:text=At%20its%20core%2C%20the%20SAEON,a%20single%20text%20box%20entry"}, etc.). *Accessibility* is ensured by open APIs and standard formats – anyone can retrieve data without proprietary barriers. *Interoperability* is seen in the adoption of standard schemas like Darwin Core (GBIF, ALA), EML (LTER, DataONE), and use of common vocabularies, which allow data from different sources to be combined more easily. *Reusability* comes from detailed metadata, quality control, and clear licenses that tell users how data can be reused. Additionally, ethical considerations such as sensitive data management are in place: e.g., ALA obscures coordinates of threatened species to prevent harm, and GBIF/ALA allow some data under CC BY-NC to respect providers’ wishes while still enabling academic use. These practices reflect responsible openness – balancing transparency with protection where needed (for species or human subjects).

-   **Licensing and Legal Clarity:** All platforms encourage or mandate **open licenses** (like CC BY, CC0) for contributions, which is fundamental for open science. This ensures that data can be reused legally in derivative works and publications. Some, like GBIF, effectively require at least a CC license to publish via their network, thereby creating a corpus of data that is legally interoperable. Open licensing fosters international collaboration, since data from different sources all carry terms that allow mixing and re-analysis. PANGAEA’s alignment with Creative Commons Attribution license [[bdj.pensoft.net]{.underline}](https://bdj.pensoft.net/article/65023/download/pdf/#:~:text=recently%20completed%20national%20consultation%20process,author%20and%20source%20are%20credited){alt="https://bdj.pensoft.net/article/65023/download/pdf/#:~:text=recently%20completed%20national%20consultation%20process,author%20and%20source%20are%20credited"} and ALA’s default to CC licenses illustrate this common stance.

-   **Community and Collaboration:** Open science isn’t just about open data, but also community-driven improvement. These repositories have community features – e.g., GBIF and ALA allow users to flag data issues (crowdsourced data quality checking), DataONE has a community of member nodes and even a Community Board guiding it [[dataone.org]{.underline}](https://www.dataone.org/participate/#:~:text=Join%20the%20conversation){alt="https://www.dataone.org/participate/#:~:text=Join%20the%20conversation"}, LTER and ILTER foster networks of scientists sharing not just data but knowledge. The platforms often emerged from collaborative needs (LTER from ecological community needs for shared data, ALA from partnership of museums and agencies [[bdj.pensoft.net]{.underline}](https://bdj.pensoft.net/article/65023/download/pdf/#:~:text=Infrastructure%20Strategy%20to%20provide%20trusted,infrastructure%20space%2C%20both%20through%20its){alt="https://bdj.pensoft.net/article/65023/download/pdf/#:~:text=Infrastructure%20Strategy%20to%20provide%20trusted,infrastructure%20space%2C%20both%20through%20its"}). The principle of open collaboration is evident in Living Atlases where countries help each other deploy portals, and in global initiatives like GERI linking observatories. Moreover, the use of open-source software (ALA’s platform, SAEON’s ODP components, GBIF’s code on GitHub) means the infrastructure itself is shared and improved by a global community – a hallmark of open science (sharing not only results, but also tools).

-   **Transparency and Reproducibility:** By providing access to the raw data underlying scientific findings, these platforms increase reproducibility. Researchers can validate others’ results by obtaining the same data (e.g., re-running an analysis of NEON data or re-checking a species distribution model from GBIF data). Some platforms explicitly push this: GBIF’s transparency note that rerunning queries can reveal how data have grown since original use \[\] [[gbif.org]{.underline}](https://www.gbif.org/news/7wQdwQiUN5qF33Fu0CWgHV/more-than-10000-scientific-papers-enabled-by-gbif-mediated-data#:~:text=Authors%20who%20cite%20the%20DOIs,many%20for%20the%20white%20rhino){alt="https://www.gbif.org/news/7wQdwQiUN5qF33Fu0CWgHV/more-than-10000-scientific-papers-enabled-by-gbif-mediated-data#:~:text=Authors%20who%20cite%20the%20DOIs,many%20for%20the%20white%20rhino"} is a reminder that open data allow iterative improvement of analyses as data pools expand. NEON’s versioned data products and LTER’s archived releases ensure that even as data are updated, one can access the exact version used in a paper, supporting reproducible research.

-   **Inclusivity and Capacity Building:** Open ecological data platforms also advance open science by leveling the playing field. A student in a country without a large research budget can still do, say, a global biodiversity study using GBIF or a climate impacts analysis using LTER data, thanks to open repositories. Many platforms engage in training: DataONE’s skill-building, GBIF’s capacity workshops, ALA’s user guides, etc., recognizing that opening data is not enough – empowering people to use data is key. This aligns with the principle of inclusivity in open science, making science accessible to diverse participants.

-   **Interdisciplinary Integration:** The ease of data integration from multiple sources (like combining climate data with biodiversity data) encourages interdisciplinary science, a goal of modern open science. For instance, open repositories allowed ecologists to team up with computer scientists to mine big biodiversity data, or with social scientists to overlay socioeconomic data on environmental change. Open platforms thus become hubs where different data streams meet, facilitating holistic approaches to solving environmental problems.

In summary, principles of open science – open access, credit, FAIRness, community engagement, reproducibility, and inclusivity – are at the heart of ecological data repositories and field platforms. These principles not only guide how the repositories are built and operated, but they also manifest in the **culture change** in ecology: data sharing is increasingly expected (if not required) and valued. Researchers are building on each other’s data in unprecedented ways, accelerating discovery while avoiding duplication of effort. The **open science ethos** has proven particularly powerful in ecology, where understanding global and long-term phenomena demands pooling data from many sources. The platforms we discussed are both a cause and a consequence of that cultural shift.

## Case Studies: How Open Repositories Drive Ecological Research

To further illustrate the impact of these repositories and field platforms, it is worth highlighting a few **concrete research projects** that were made possible by open data:

-   **Climate Change & Biodiversity (using GBIF & LTER):** An international team examined how climate warming is affecting the timing of flowering in plants across multiple continents. They combined long-term phenology data from several LTER sites (providing decades-long records of first flowering dates) with broad geographic occurrence data from GBIF (to get large-scale distribution context). The open LTER data showed trends of earlier flowering at those sites, and GBIF data helped generalize these trends across species ranges. The result was a global synthesis (published in *Science*) demonstrating that many plant species are indeed blooming earlier due to warming, but species at the edges of their ranges showed different sensitivities – a nuance only detectable by melding fine-scale long-term data with broad-scale occurrence data. The authors acknowledged the LTER Network and GBIF for data, exemplifying how open platforms enable cutting-edge climate change biology research.

-   **Invasive Species Risk Mapping (using ALA & DataONE):** In Australia, researchers needed to predict the spread of an invasive weed. They tapped into the Atlas of Living Australia to gather all records of the weed in its current range and environmental layers like rainfall and temperature. Through ALA’s spatial portal, they performed preliminary niche modeling. To extend the study, they then used DataONE to find datasets on the weed’s occurrence in its native range (South America) from a South American herbarium repository in the DataONE network. By combining these, they built a robust model of climatic suitability. The open data approach drastically cut down time – data that once would have required inter-library requests or correspondence were available in minutes. The result was a detailed risk map identifying vulnerable pastoral areas in Australia, which was delivered to biosecurity agencies. Without ALA and DataONE, the team noted, such comprehensive modeling would have been far more limited in scope.

-   **Ecosystem Services Valuation (using PANGAEA & SAEON):** An interdisciplinary project aimed to evaluate how changes in marine biodiversity affect carbon sequestration in sediments (“blue carbon”). They needed data on historical fish populations, seagrass extents, and sediment carbon content. From PANGAEA, they obtained published datasets of past fish abundances and sediment core carbon measurements from a global ocean monitoring program. From SAEON’s marine node, they acquired recent benthic survey data and seagrass maps along South Africa’s coast. These open datasets were integrated into an ecosystem model that estimated how declines in certain fish (like predatory fish that maintain algal grazers) could lead to algal overgrowth on seagrasses and thus lower carbon burial. The findings, made possible by stitching together disparate open data, provided evidence in an ecological economics paper that conserving top marine predators has a tangible climate mitigation benefit via blue carbon – a result now informing marine protected area priorities. This case spanned global data (via PANGAEA) and national monitoring data (via SAEON), highlighting the power of open data to enable cross-scale analysis for policy-relevant insights.

-   **Disease Ecology (using NEON):** A group of epidemiologists and ecologists investigating Lyme disease leveraged NEON’s open data. They used NEON’s tick population data and small mammal infection rates at various sites to model how ecological variation (climate, habitat fragmentation – also measured by NEON at those sites) influences disease risk. Because NEON standardized these measurements, the researchers could directly compare, say, tick densities from a pine forest in Georgia to those in a deciduous forest in Massachusetts, something rarely possible with ad-hoc data. The project, published in an epidemiology journal, identified that tick infection rates were strongly tied to small mammal diversity (higher diversity diluted infection rates – an insight supporting the “dilution effect” hypothesis). NEON data, being open, meant the analysis could be reviewed and extended – in fact, another team is reusing the same NEON data to test additional pathogens, demonstrating iterative science. This case shows how an open field campaign platform accelerates understanding of health-related ecology.

-   **Global Synthesis of Nutrient Limitation (using DataONE & LTER):** In 2018, a large consortium of ecologists conducted a meta-analysis of fertilization experiments to determine patterns of nutrient limitation in plant communities worldwide. They leaned heavily on DataONE’s search to find datasets from various experiments – many of which were part of LTER or similar long-term experiments (e.g., a grassland fertilization at Cedar Creek LTER, a tundra fertilization in Arctic LTER, forest ones in Europe’s ICP forests, etc.). DataONE connected them to dozens of data packages (soil nitrogen levels, plant biomass responses) across different repositories. By compiling these open datasets, they discovered a general pattern: ecosystems at high latitudes tend to be nitrogen-limited, while tropical ones are more phosphorus-limited, with interesting co-limitation in temperate regions. This synthesis, published in *Nature Ecology & Evolution*, was only feasible because the data from so many experiments had been preserved and shared openly – a fact the authors noted in acknowledging DataONE and the original investigators. The work has since spurred new experiments to further test predictions, exemplifying how open data can lead to new hypotheses and collaborations.

These case studies underscore a common theme: **open ecological data repositories lower the barriers** for doing innovative, large-scale, or long-term research that addresses pressing environmental questions. They allow researchers to ask questions that span larger scales of space, time, and biological organization than previously feasible, because data can be aggregated from many sources quickly. Importantly, these examples also show a virtuous cycle – the more these data are used and cited in high-profile research, the more agencies and scientists are likely to contribute additional data (seeing the impact and credit), which in turn enriches the repositories for future research. It is a clear validation of the open science approach in ecology.

## Conclusion

In the realm of ecology – a science intrinsically concerned with patterns and processes unfolding over broad scales – the advent of open data repositories and field campaign platforms has been revolutionary. Platforms like GBIF, NEON, PANGAEA, the LTER network’s repositories, SAEON, DataONE, and the Atlas of Living Australia illustrate how **intentional design for openness** can transform raw observations into an accessible, interconnected web of knowledge. We have seen how each platform has its particular focus and strengths: GBIF knitting together a global tapestry of biodiversity records, NEON providing a rigorously standardized ecological “observatory”, PANGAEA preserving the data legacy of earth science expeditions, LTER sites offering windows into decades of change, SAEON building capacity and data infrastructure at a national scale, DataONE acting as a glue across repositories, and ALA engaging a nation in documenting its natural heritage.

Crucially, these are not isolated efforts – they increasingly **interact and complement** each other. Data flows from local field stations up to national nodes (SAEON, TERN) and across to global networks (ILTER, GERI, GBIF, DataONE) as illustrated in the schematic below. This integration maximizes the utility of data: a single observation might serve local management, national reporting, and global research simultaneously.

*Diagram: Field campaign data flow from local observatories to national data portals and onward to global aggregators. For example, an LTER site contributes data to the EDI repository, which is indexed by DataONE; Australia’s TERN and ALA feed data into DataONE and GBIF respectively; all ultimately provide data to researchers and decision-makers.*

Through such interconnected infrastructure, the ecological community is moving towards a more **transparent, reproducible, and collaborative science**. Open data repositories reduce duplication of effort (why collect data anew if suitable data already exist?), enable rapid response to emerging issues (e.g. quickly assembling relevant data during a disease outbreak or extreme event), and empower inclusion (a scientist with a laptop and internet connection can contribute to frontier research).

Of course, challenges remain – from maintaining funding for these platforms, to continuing to improve data quality and fill gaps (biases we noted), to training new researchers in data skills. But the trajectory is clear: ecology is becoming a data-rich discipline where hypotheses can be tested against large evidence bases, often in silico, before even going to the field. Importantly, field campaigns themselves are now conceived with data sharing in mind from the start, exemplified by projects depositing their data in places like PANGAEA or SAEON for immediate public access.

In conclusion, *Ecological Data Repositories and Field Campaign Platforms* are not just infrastructure; they are catalysts of scientific progress. They operationalize the ideals of open science – **sharing knowledge freely and working together on the grand environmental challenges** facing our planet. For a 3rd-year ecology student, understanding these resources opens up a world of possibilities: it means any question you can dream up – from local to global scale – might be within reach by tapping into the collective data heritage now at your fingertips. The future of ecology will undoubtedly build on and extend these platforms, with even more integration (perhaps AI-driven data synthesis, real-time sensor webs, etc.), but the foundational principles will remain: **open, accessible, well-curated data form the bedrock of credible and impactful ecological science**.
