# Ecological Data Repositories & Field Platforms

Harnessing Open Ecological Data for Research at Scale\
Phemelo Rutlokoane — 2025

# Why Ecological Data Matters

-   Ecological systems are complex and variable\
-   Long-term, large-scale data is needed\
-   Open science = reproducibility + collaboration

# Defining the Landscape

-   Open data repositories\
-   Field campaign platforms\
-   Global and local examples\
-   Emphasis on FAIR principles

# GBIF – Global Biodiversity Info Facility

-   Billions of species occurrence records\
-   Darwin Core metadata standards\
-   Strengths: scale, openness, citation\
-   Limits: bias, lack of absences

# NEON – U.S. Observatory Network

-   81 sites across eco-climatic zones\
-   Sensors + remote sensing + biotic surveys\
-   Standardised, API-supported\
-   Limits: only U.S., complexity

# PANGAEA – Earth & Env Data

-   Multidisciplinary georeferenced data\
-   Curated metadata + DOIs\
-   Excellent for oceanography, climate\
-   Limits: mostly static data

# LTER – Long Term Ecological Research

-   U.S.-based, site-level long-term studies\
-   Rich temporal resolution\
-   Data via EDI (Environmental Data Initiative)\
-   Limits: site heterogeneity

# SAEON – South Africa’s Network

-   Long-term ecological monitoring\
-   Marine, terrestrial, limnology\
-   Data platform: ulwazi.saeon.ac.za\
-   Strength: National integration

# DataONE – Aggregated Access

-   Portal indexing datasets from many sources\
-   Emphasis on metadata, discoverability\
-   Supports Data Packages\
-   Limits: metadata consistency

# Atlas of Living Australia (ALA)

-   Species distribution + citizen science\
-   Portal and analytical tools\
-   Linked to GBIF\
-   Limits: Australia-specific

# Case Study 1: Climate & Phenology

-   GBIF + LTER = flowering time shifts\
-   Global warming signal evident

# Case Study 2: Invasives & Risk

-   ALA + DataONE = species distribution models\
-   Applied to biosecurity and risk mapping

# Case Study 3: Ecosystem Services

-   PANGAEA + SAEON: marine biodiversity + carbon flux\
-   Ecological economics

# Integration and Data Flows
